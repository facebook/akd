//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate contains a "lean" client to verify AKD proofs which doesn't depend on any
//! crates other than the native hashing implementations and optionally VRF usage. This makes it suitable
//! for embedded applications, e.g. inside limited clients (Android, iPhone, WebAssembly, etc)
//! which may not have a large dependency library they can pull upon.
//!
//! ## Present proof validation
//!
//! At the time of this documentation authoring, we presently support LookupProof verification
//! without depending on the full AKD library.
//!
//! ## Planned future support
//!
//! Going forward this crate will re-implement the client verifications of the base crate, but with
//! this "lean" mentality in mind. Should you not be running in a constrained environment then feel free to simply
//! use the base AKD library crate.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! The features of this library are
//!
//! 1. **default** blake3: Blake3 256-bit hashing
//! 2. sha256: SHA2 256-bit hashing
//! 3. sha512: SHA3 512-bit hashing
//! 4. sha3_256: SHA3 256-bit hashing
//! 5. sha3_512: SHA3 512-bit hashing
//!
//! which dictate which hashing function is used by the verification components. Blake3 256-bit hashing is the default
//! implementation and utilizes the [`blake3`] crate. Features sha256 and sha512 both utilize SHA2 cryptographic functions
//! from the [`sha2`](https://crates.io/crates/sha2) crate. Lastly sha3_256 and sha3_512 features utilize the
//! [`sha3`](https://crates.io/crates/sha3) crate for their hashing implementations.
//! To utilize a hash implementation other than blake3, you should compile with
//!
//! ```bash
//! //          [disable blake3]      [enable other hash]
//! cargo build --no-default-features --features sha3_256
//! ```
//!
//! ### Additional features
//!
//! Additionally there are some features **not** related to the underlying hash function utilization
//!
//! 1. _wasm_: Compile with web-assembly support for WASM compilation
//! 2. _wee_alloc_: Utilize the WEE allocator, which is roughly 1KB instead of 10KB as a allocator but slower. This
//! is _helpful_ in cases of constrained binary footprint size to help minimize
//! 3. _nostd_: Disable use of the std library
//! 4. _vrf_: Enable verification of VRFs client-side. Requires addition of the crates [`curve25519-dalek`] and [`ed25519-dalek`]
//! as dependencies
//!
//! You can compile and pack the WASM output with
//! ```bash
//! cd akd_client # optional
//! wasm-pack build --features wasm
//! ```
//! which currently has a resultant WASM file size of ~191KB with VRF verification enabled
//!
//! #### WASM Compilation and Deployment
//!
//! For WASM deployment of the AKD client, you'll want to read the [wasm_bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/deployment.html)
//! documentation which has reference material dependent on your environment.
//!
//! # Client Types
//!
//! A small note about the types in this library. They are specifically independent of the main AKD crate because
//! it's assumed that to perform a verification at the edge, the client will have had to receive some over-the-air
//! message which contains the data inside the proof. Therefore they'd need to be deserialized and handled independently
//! of the AKD crate which wouldn't be a dependency anyways. This is why the types are independent and specified separately
//! from the core AKD types.
