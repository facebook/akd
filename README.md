## SEEMless ![Build Status](https://github.com/novifinancial/SEEMless/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An implementation of a verifiable key directory (also known as a verifiable registry).

Verifiable key directories can be used to help provide key transparency for end-to-end encrypted
messaging.

This implementation is based off of the protocol described in
[SEEMless: Secure End-to-End Encrypted Messaging with less trust](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/607).

This library provides a stateless API for a verifiable key directory, meaning that a consumer of this library must provide their own solution for the storage of the entries of the directory.

Documentation
-------------

The API can be found [here](https://docs.rs/seemless/) along with an example for usage.

Installation
------------

Add the following line to the dependencies of your `Cargo.toml`:

```

```

### Minimum Supported Rust Version
