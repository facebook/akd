## akd ![Build Status](https://github.com/novifinancial/akd/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An implementation of an auditable key directory (also known as a verifiable registry).

Auditable key directories can be used to help provide key transparency for end-to-end encrypted
messaging.

This implementation is based off of the protocol described in
[SEEMless: Secure End-to-End Encrypted Messaging with less trust](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/607).

This library provides a stateless API for an auditable key directory, meaning that a consumer of this library must provide their own solution for the storage of the entries of the directory.

⚠️ **Warning**: This implementation has not been audited and is not ready for a production application. Use at your own risk!
