## akd ![Build Status](https://github.com/novifinancial/akd/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An implementation of a MySQL storage layer for the auditable key directory (also known as a verifiable registry).

Auditable key directories can be used to help provide key transparency for end-to-end encrypted
messaging.

This implementation is based off of the protocol described in
[SEEMless: Secure End-to-End Encrypted Messaging with less trust](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/607).

This library provides an implementation of the ```Storage``` trait for a MySQL database.

⚠️ **Warning**: This implementation has not been audited and is not ready for a production application. Use at your own risk!
