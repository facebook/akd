//! This crate implements a basic MySQL storage layer for the auditable key directory.
//!
//! ⚠️ **Warning**: This implementation has not been audited and is not ready for use in a real system. Use at your own risk!
//! # Overview
//! MySQL is a common storage layer utilized in many deployments. Having a simple, yet performant, storage layer is useful for real applications
//! which may want to utilize the AKD structure. This crate implements a data-layer for MySQL which properly supports all of the calls required
//! by the AKD directory logic at a good performance level. At reasonable scale, on a decent MySQL instance, one can expect publishing 100K records
//! in approximately 10-20 minutes.
//!
