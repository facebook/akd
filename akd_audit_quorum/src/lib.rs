//! This crate implements the membership logic for a participant of a the witness pool which verifies
//! the append-only nature of the key directory. This is to be deployed in a cluster and will inter-communicate
//! between nodes in order to pass shard logic, manage enrollment & de-enrollment, and sign proof + emit it to stable storage.
//!
//! ⚠️ **Warning**: This implementation has not been audited and is not ready for use in a real system. Use at your own risk!
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! To prevent a split-view attack the root hash of every epoch needs to have a signature signed by a private key which cannot be leaked from the quorum
//! (via shared-secret methodology). This quorum participates to independently validate the append-only proof of the key directory and each participant
//! provides their partial shard of the quorum signing key and when enough participants agree, the changes are signed off on and stored in persistent storage.
//!
//! That way a proof only needs to give the root hash, and the signature on it to ascertain the quorum has agreed on the changes, and the AKD
//! (or any other 3rd party) cannot generate its own signatures.
//!
//! Eventually these auditors can be participants from external entities who can participate in the quorum vote.
//!
//! ## Requirements
//!
//! 1. The Quorum Key (QK) is long-lived and securely managed such that individual (or a few) participants cannot generate their own signatures and invalidate the trust of the system
//! 2. The quorum participants can evolve over time (i.e. removal in the face of failures, and additions for future collaborative growth or upgrades).
//! 3. Communication channels are secure, such that 3rd parties cannot sniff the key shares over the wire and compromise the QK.
//! 4. The public key of the QK is publicly distributed such that it's easy to client-side validate the validity of the epochs without additional I/O operations to a potentially malicious acting key directory.
//!
//! # Design overview:
//!
//! A Quorum Key is generated at the beginning of the life of the quorum, and the private key is broken into "shards" via
//! [Shamir secret sharing](https://github.com/dsprenkels/sss-rs).
//! These shards are transmitted to the quorum participants who hold them in secure storage. The shards are generated with the following properties
//!
//! 1. There are 3 _f_ + 1 nodes in the quorum
//! 2. 2 _f_ + 1 nodes need to agree to reconstruct the signing key (quorum key)
//! 3. The public key is given publicly to every client which will need to verify the signature
//!
//! ## Communcation with the quorum
//!
//! The collection of nodes in this quorum receive commands from an external 3rd party (key directory epoch notification or admin interface for example).
//! The messages they can receive are the following
//!
//! 1. New epoch publication - The AKD has published a new epoch and the quorum should validate the changes and generate a signature
//! 2. Quorum member enrollment - The quorum should attempt to add the new member to the set. A series of independent tests will be
//! performed against the new member and if they pass, a new shard-set will be generated and the node enrolled
//! 3. Quorum member removal - The quorum has a member which should be removed. If 2 _f_ + 1 nodes agree, the Quorum Key is reconstructed and new shards are generated and
//! distributed to the remaining membership.
//!
//! For any of these messages, whichever node receives the request is denoted as the leader. We do not need the full [RAFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm))
//! protocol, since we have no need for a persistent leader and the nodes are effectively stateless in between operations.
//! The temporary request leader is responsible for communicating with the other quorum members and gathering
//! their votes, reconstructing the shards, and either signing the commitment or enrolling the new member (re-generating shards and transmitting them).
//!
//! ## Inter-node communication scheme
//!
//! The inter-node messages are still to be defined at the state of this version, however they should be built & encoded with a backwards-compatable
//! encoding scheme such that they can be upgraded in the future as new members, with potentially upgraded logic, are deployed.
//!
//! ## Retrieval of the latest commitment
//!
//! Since the public key is available to anyone who cares, external parties can read directly from the storage layer to minimize I/O to the quorum, as they
//! will likely be resource constrained with validating the commitments between epochs and processing membership changes.
//!
//! NOTE: If the storage layer is mutated directly, then the quorum will start failing commitments and signatures will not match so the system fault will be detectable.
